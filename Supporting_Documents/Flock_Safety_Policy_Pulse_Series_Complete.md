# Part 1: Policy Pulse: Compliance Doesn't Have to Be So Hard

**By Josh Thomas**  
**September 12, 2025**

There is a certain cruelty in crime, not simply in the act itself but in its *aftermath*. The bewildered families left behind, the long shadow of unanswered questions, the silence of what we cannot explain. A child struck in Dallas, his future nearly stolen. A bombing in Palm Springs that might have shattered generations. Eight hundred fentanyl pills in Lake County, each one a bullet aimed at strangers who would never see it coming. Because the truth today is, despite violent crime trending downward, most crime still remains stubbornly, maddeningly unsolved.

These stories are not statistics. They are not the cold abstractions of policy briefings that sit in the stale air of conference rooms. They are real lives. They are real communities forever changed. And if there is one lesson they teach us, it is this: crime is solvable, but it does not respect boundaries. Not the sacred boundary of your personal, private life or home. Not the invisible line between cities. Not the rugged miles between states. Certainly not the legal constructs we call jurisdictions.

That is why cooperation between law enforcement agencies, private companies, individuals, technology builders, and policy makers is not a luxury. It is a necessity. When a kidnapped baby from California is recovered in Arizona, or when a double murder suspect flees Texas and is located in Arkansas, it is not because of any one town or one sheriff or one department. It is because neighbors, however far apart, recognized a shared responsibility. This is in fact the genesis of Flock Safety's name, mission, and product vision: the recognition that it takes all of us working together to impact crime.

## The path to cooperation has always been uneven

America's strength lies in its differences, and the wisdom of our structure as a federation to ensure those differences are protected. We designate power to local officials, governed by the Constitution above all, to ensure that individual communities can govern themselves in a way that feels authentic to their own values.

But what this also means is that compliance in America is hard. Every jurisdiction has its own laws, its own mandates, its own interpretation of how justice must be administered based on its own values. What is permissible in Texas may be restricted in California. What is authorized in Illinois may be forbidden in Georgia. And they turn the promise of shared safety into a patchwork of obligations, the burden of each one threatening to unravel the whole.

This is not an issue that's unique to Flock. This is a uniquely American issue.

## Introducing Policy Pulse

And yet, we will not shrink from our responsibility. In fact, central to Flock's ethos is our commitment to democracy. Flock doesn't dictate the rules and we will not erode democratic autonomy. We're presenting this new blog series, ***Policy Pulse,*** because the burden of compliance - navigating this messy lattice of rules and oversight - should not stand in the way of public safety. And so our commitment is not just to solve crimes, but to ensure the act of crime-solving is lawful, transparent, and easy.

Any user. Any city. Any legal framework. Flock will support the ability of those who have shouldered the heavy burden of crimefighting to carry that load. Whether Dallas or Palm Springs, Illinois or Arkansas. Whether you are protecting one business or an entire county. We must ensure that Flock provides both the technology to catch the guilty, and the clarity to assure the innocent that their rights remain intact. We provide tools that make it easier to see what you are doing within the Flock system, know with whom you are sharing, audit that usage, and comply with the mandates of law.

> We provide the tools, but your city owns the data. Your city controls how it metes out justice.

In a country where rules compete, where compliance is often the enemy of cooperation, we're committed to offering something different: the chance to reconcile safety with sovereignty, progress with principle. Because the work of Flock is not only catching the wrongdoer. It is proving, to every community, that we can do so without compromising the values that make our communities what they are.

# Part 2: Policy Pulse: The Work Already Underway

**By Josh Thomas**  
**October 2, 2025**

It is one thing to name the challenge of 50 state compliance. It is another to demonstrate, week by week, how Flock takes that challenge seriously. Already, changes have been made, designed to uphold both the letter of the law and the trust of the communities we serve.

### **Keyword Filters**

We have introduced keyword filters that stand guard against LPR-related searches prohibited by law. Too often, compliance is treated as paperwork, as after-the-fact audits. But these filters are different. They are active, alive in the system, blocking attempts to search for terms related to civil immigration or reproductive healthcare where state law forbids it. If a prohibited search is made, the filter does not waver. And it's actively working today.

### **Federal Organization Designation**

Communities often don't understand the blurred line between local policing and federal task forces to solve some of society's most heinous crimes like human trafficking, and collaboration can be imperative to saving a life. However, some state laws restrict these relationships, and we want local agencies to be clear before accepting any request. Therefore, we created a federal organization designation, ensuring transparency when federal agencies request access to LPR footage from state or local partners. Now, the Flock system will label every request with its federal origin. Local officials, accountable to their own laws and citizens, will know exactly who is asking and why. And with that knowledge comes the power to decide in accordance with policy, law, and community values.

### **Limitations on Federal Access**

Finally, we have imposed strict limitations on federal access itself. Federal agencies cannot reach into Virginia or California data, no matter where they are based. Nor can they access Statewide or National Lookups. These restrictions are not designed to handicap law enforcement, but to honor the sovereignty of states and the will of their people.

Each of these steps points to a larger principle: compliance is not an obstacle to safety, but its foundation. By building these protections directly into the system, we make it easier for law enforcement to pursue justice without straying from the bounds of law. Stay tuned for our next round of safety and compliance updates.

# Part 3: Policy Pulse: Transparency, Control, and the Path Forward

**By Josh Thomas**  
**November 12, 2025**

*This is the third part in our Policy Pulse series on compliance and trust features. Read* [*Part 1*](https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/policy-pulse-compliance-doesnt-have-to-be-so-hard) *and* [*Part 2*](https://www.flocksafety.com/blog/policy-pulse-the-work-already-underway)*.*

At the heart of democracy, trust must be earned. Not once, but daily, with every action and every choice. And those entrusted with authority must wield it with the care and transparency that the public can see, without obfuscation.

At Flock Safety, transparency is not a bug, but a feature. It's baked into all the products we ship. For law enforcement agencies, transparency is not a catchphrase. It is the living record that shows every search, every audit, every moment where technology intersects with justice. And it is the public, watching closely, who asks: were these searches done responsibly, and for the right reasons?

That is why today we are sharing two new updates to the search experience of Flock products.

## **More Control Over Public Search Audits**

In the past, law enforcement agencies had little choice in how public search audits were exported from the Transparency Portal. The field of Search Reason was always included, without the option to remove it. And oftentimes, an officer may include sensitive information in this field regarding a current, active investigation. At the same time, a crucial detail, Case Number. was missing, even though many departments rely on it for clear recordkeeping.

Now, that changes. Agencies have direct control over their exports when complying with public oversight requests. With a single decision, they can:

* Include Search Reason
* Include Case Number
* Include both
* Or remove both entirely

This flexibility means agencies can shape their reports to match their policies and their community's expectations. It is, at its core, a restoration of local autonomy—while ensuring that accountability remains uncompromised.

## **Mandatory Offense Type Selection**

Accountability is not only about what the public can see after the fact. It is also about how officers document their intent in the moment. That is why, beginning next month, we are introducing a mandatory Offense Type dropdown, originating from NIBRS offense categories, before any search is performed.

This ensures every search begins with clarity: a declaration of the specific offense under investigation. For agencies, this creates a stronger audit trail. For the public, it provides a sharper view into why a search occurred, and whether it aligns with both policy and principle.

## **The Bigger Picture**

We know many communities and departments rely on Transparency Portals to demonstrate compliance with their own standards and values. These new tools allow greater control over audit exports, and mandatory offense documentation, which remain part of our ongoing commitment to make compliance much, much easier.

Accountability should not be a burden. Transparency should not be a barrier. They should be the natural byproducts of systems designed with both justice and democracy in mind.

These changes are live today for every law enforcement agency using Flock. They are small steps, but they point in a single direction: toward a future where compliance and community trust walk hand in hand.
