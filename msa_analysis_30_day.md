## **Footage vs Customer Data Relationship**

- Customer Data = "data, media and content provided by Customer through the Services. **For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer Data will include the Footage.**"
- Footage = "still images, video, audio and other data captured by the Flock Hardware or Customer Hardware" (MSA §1.10)

## **30-Day Retention Policy**

**What gets deleted after 30 days:**
- **Footage** (actual camera captures) - deleted on rolling 30-day basis (MSA Recitals)
- Unless designated as evidence or otherwise specified in Order Form

**What's retained indefinitely:**
- **User queries with user profiles** - retained indefinitely for auditing (FAQ)
- **Evidence** - any footage designated as evidence stored in Evidence.Com indefinitely (FAQ)
- **Audit logs** - all requests and queries are logged and auditable (FAQ)

## **Critical Nuances**

**Hot Plates:**
- 30-day expiration by default
- Administrator reviews after expiration to determine if extension needed
- Removed once investigative purpose achieved

**Customer responsibilities:**
- Must extract, download, and archive footage to own storage devices (MSA Recitals)
- If agency wants footage beyond 30 days without evidence designation, they must download it themselves

**Data ownership:**
- Customer retains all ownership of Customer Data (including Footage) (MSA §4.1)
- Flock receives limited license to use for providing services
- Flock does not own and shall not sell Customer Data

**Disclosure rights:**
- During Retention Period, Flock may disclose Footage to law enforcement/government if legally required or good faith belief it's necessary for legal process, security, fraud, technical issues, or emergencies (MSA §5.3)

Your conclusion about the permanent audit trail creating an enduring record of searches even after footage deletion is particularly significant for privacy considerations.
