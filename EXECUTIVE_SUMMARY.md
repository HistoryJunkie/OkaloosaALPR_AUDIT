## Key Findings

### 1. Data Retention Policy Violated

OCSO publicly claims data is deleted every 30 days. Audit evidence shows 463 searches accessed data up to 524 days old—routine searches for "patrol" and traffic violations accessed year-old data.

### 2. Nationwide Surveillance Capability

Nearly half (46.8%) of searches queried multiple networks. The average multi-network search accessed 1,800 networks; the largest accessed 6,709 networks and 100,034 cameras simultaneously.

### 3. Accountability Blocked

100% redaction of officer names and case numbers makes it impossible to verify whether searches served legitimate purposes. The "audit" capability advertised to the public is meaningless.

### 4. Contract Favors Vendor

The Flock Safety contract limits liability to 12 months of fees, lacks breach notification requirements, and grants Flock perpetual rights to use "anonymized" data for machine learning.

## Implications

### For Citizens

- License plates function as permanent tracking beacons
- Travel history retained far beyond stated policy
- No way to know if you've been searched or why

### For Policy

- Stated policies do not match operational reality
- Oversight mechanisms are ineffective
- Multi-agency networks bypass local control

### For Accountability

- Redacted audits prevent verification
- No independent oversight exists
- Vendor contract lacks accountability provisions

---

## Recommendations

1. **Enforce Retention Limits** - Technical controls preventing access beyond stated retention period
2. **Require Justification** - Block searches without documented criminal justice purpose
3. **Enable Real Audits** - Disclose officer/case information for accountability
4. **Limit Network Scope** - Require warrant or supervisor approval for multi-network searches
5. **Renegotiate Contract** - Add breach notification, audit rights, and meaningful liability
