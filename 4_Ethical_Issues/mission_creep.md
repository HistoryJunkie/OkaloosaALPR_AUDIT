# Mission Creep Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes whether the OCSO Flock Safety ALPR system is being used beyond its original stated purpose, and tracks the expansion of surveillance capabilities over time.

---

## 1. Original Justification vs. Current Use

### Stated Purpose (OCSO Public Communications)

From OCSO FAQ and press release:
> [Quote original justification]

**Original Stated Uses:**
1. Stolen vehicle recovery
2. AMBER Alerts
3. Missing persons
4. Wanted fugitives
5. [Other stated purposes]

### Observed Uses (Audit Data)

**Justification Categories from 7,273 searches:**

| Reason Category | Count | Percentage | Original Purpose? |
|-----------------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| BOLO | [Count] | [%] | Yes |
| Investigation | [Count] | [%] | Yes |
| Stolen Vehicle | [Count] | [%] | Yes |
| Missing Person | [Count] | [%] | Yes |
| Warrant | [Count] | [%] | Yes |
| Patrol | [Count] | [%] | **QUESTIONABLE** |
| DWLSR | [Count] | [%] | **QUESTIONABLE** |
| Traffic | [Count] | [%] | **QUESTIONABLE** |
| LEO | [Count] | [%] | **VAGUE** |
| Test | [Count] | [%] | **QUESTIONABLE** |
| Deputy Request | [Count] | [%] | **VAGUE** |
| (Blank) | 9 | [%] | **VIOLATION** |

### Gap Analysis

**Uses Beyond Original Scope:**

1. **General Patrol Surveillance**
   - "Patrol" justification: [X] searches
   - Concern: Converts ALPR from investigative to dragnet tool

2. **Traffic Enforcement**
   - "DWLSR" (Driving While License Suspended): [X] searches
   - Concern: Using anti-crime tool for revenue/minor violations

3. **Vague/Undefined Uses**
   - "LEO," "Test," "Deputy Request"
   - Concern: No specific criminal justice purpose

## 2. Capability Expansion Timeline

### Known Flock Capabilities

| Capability | Original? | Current | Evidence |
|------------|-----------|---------|----------|
| License plate reading | Yes | Yes | Core function |
| Vehicle make/model/color | [Research] | Yes | MSA "Vehicle Fingerprint" |
| Bumper stickers | [Research] | Yes | MSA definition |
| Bike racks | [Research] | Yes | MSA definition |
| Audio detection | [Research] | Yes | MSA §1.9 |
| Multi-network search | [Research] | Yes | 6,709 networks observed |
| Historical search | [Research] | Yes | 524 days observed |

### "Vehicle Fingerprint" Definition (MSA §1.14)

> "The unique vehicular attributes captured through Services such as: type, make, color, state registration, missing/covered plates, bumper stickers, decals, roof racks, and bike racks."

**Concern:** System captures far more than license plates - essentially vehicle profiling.

### Audio Detection (MSA §1.9)

> Services include "audio detection"

**Questions:**
- [ ] What audio is being captured?
- [ ] Gunshot detection?
- [ ] Voice/conversation recording?
- [ ] What is retention period for audio?

## 3. Network Expansion

### Local to National Creep

| Metric | Implied Scope | Actual Scope |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| OCSO cameras only | Local | 53.17% of searches |
| Multi-network | - | 46.83% of searches |
| Average networks (multi) | - | 1,800 |
| Maximum networks | - | 6,709 |
| Maximum devices | - | 100,034 |

### Questions

1. Did OCSO explicitly authorize nationwide searches?
2. Did the county commission approve network sharing?
3. Were citizens informed of nationwide tracking?
4. What agreements govern cross-jurisdictional searches?

---

## 4. Temporal Expansion

### Retention Creep

| Stated Policy | Observed Maximum | Expansion Factor |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| 30 days | 524 days | 17.5x |

### Historical Access Justifications

For searches >30 days old:

| Justification | Count | Appropriateness |
|---------------|-------|-----------------|
| Patrol | 45 | Inappropriate - no historical need |
| [Category] | [Count] | [Assessment] |

---

## 5. Hot List Expansion

### Original Hot List Categories (per MSA)

- Stolen vehicles
- Wanted persons
- Missing persons
- AMBER Alerts
- NCIC data

### Potential Expanded Categories

- [ ] Immigration enforcement?
- [ ] Civil matters (repossession)?
- [ ] Intelligence gathering?
- [ ] Protest monitoring?

### Data Needed

- Hot list composition breakdown
- Manual addition policies
- Cross-agency hot list sharing

---

## 6. Comparison to Legal Limits

### Florida Statute 316.0778 - Permitted Uses

> [Quote statutory language on permitted uses]

### Observed Uses vs. Statutory Limits

| Use Category | Statutorily Permitted? | Observed? |
|--------------|----------------------|-----------|
| [Use 1] | [Yes/No] | [Yes/No] |
| [Use 2] | [Yes/No] | [Yes/No] |

### FDLE Guidelines - Recommended Limits

> [Quote FDLE guidance on appropriate uses]

**Compliance Assessment:**
- [ ] [Guideline 1]: [Compliant/Non-compliant]
- [ ] [Guideline 2]: [Compliant/Non-compliant]

## 7. Governance Gap Analysis

### Oversight Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Exists? | Effective? |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| Written ALPR policy | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] |
| Use case restrictions | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] |
| Supervisor approval | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] |
| Audit review | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] |
| Public reporting | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] |
| Complaint process | [Yes/No] | [Assessment] |

### Policy Recommendations

1. **Define Permitted Uses**
   - Enumerate specific authorized purposes
   - Prohibit general patrol surveillance
   - Require case number for all searches

2. **Limit Network Scope**
   - Require justification for multi-network searches
   - Supervisor approval for >X networks
   - Prohibit nationwide dragnets without warrant

3. **Enforce Retention Limits**
   - Technical controls on historical access
   - Exception process for legitimate investigations
   - Audit of all >30-day searches

4. **Transparency Requirements**
   - Public reporting on use categories
   - Annual disclosure of search statistics
   - Camera location disclosure

- [ ] Identify searches outside original scope
- [ ] Research OCSO ALPR policy documents
- [ ] Compare to FDLE guidelines
- [ ] Document capability additions over time
- [ ] Interview privacy advocates on mission creep
- [ ] Research other jurisdictions' use restrictions
