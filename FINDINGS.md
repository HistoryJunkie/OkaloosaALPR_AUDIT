# PUBLIC STATEMENT: ANALYSIS OF OCSO ALPR RETENTION DISCREPANCIES AND SURVEILLANCE SCALE

**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Subject:** Empirical Discrepancies in ALPR Data Retention, Justification, and Transparency

## 1. Executive Summary

This statement analyzes the operational data of the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office (OCSO) Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR) system. While public communications from the agency state a 30-day data retention policy, audit logs reveal a significant volume of searches extending up to 1.5 years into the past, as well as a heavy reliance on a massive interconnected network of thousands of external camera systems.

## 2. The Retention Discrepancy (Policy vs. Operation)

The OCSO official website specifies that its Flock Safety system "deletes its data every 30 days on a rolling basis." The audit data, however, identifies a systematic circumvention of this limit:

* **Total Violations of the 30-Day Limit:** There are 463 verified instances where searches looked back further than 30 days into the past.
* **The 1.5-Year Reach:** The most extreme search looked back 524 days (roughly 1.5 years). Numerous other searches targeted windows of 360+ days.
* **Routine Justifications for "Time Travel":** These long-term historical searches were frequently used for non-emergency reasons:
   * **"Patrol":** 45 instances (accessing 1.5 years of history for general patrol activity).
   * **Administrative/Traffic:** "DWLSR" (Driving While License Suspended), "stolen tags," and "warrant service."
   * **Low-Level Entries:** Justifications like "leo," "test," and "deputy request" were used to access data older than 30 days.

## 3. Local vs. Global Surveillance (Network Scale)

The audit reveals that OCSO does not merely search its own cameras; it utilizes a vast web of external networks:

* **Single Network (Local) Searches:** 3,867 searches (53.17%) were conducted on just one network (presumably OCSO's own cameras).
* **Multi-Network (Expanded) Searches:** 3,406 searches (46.83%)—nearly half of all activity—expanded beyond the local network.
* **Massive Integration:** For searches involving multiple networks, the average query reached across 1,800 different networks. The largest individual search queried 6,709 networks simultaneously.
* **Device Dragnets:** Individual searches queried as many as 100,034 devices at once. This indicates that a single query by an Okaloosa deputy can track a vehicle across a massive, interconnected web of thousands of private and municipal cameras nationwide.

## 4. Searches Without Justification

The audit identifies 9 specific instances where the "Reason" field was left completely blank.

* These searches were conducted using the "search" type, meaning an officer actively queried the database without providing the required statutory or policy-mandated justification. Without a stated reason, there is no way to ensure these searches complied with Florida's "Criminal Justice Purpose" requirement.

## 5. Redacted Accountability

OCSO has redacted 100% of the names of officers and 100% of case numbers from the audit logs.

* **Impact:** By removing the officer's identity and the specific case file, OCSO has made it impossible to verify if the 463 "long-term" searches or the 9 "blank" searches were lawful or abusive.
* **Public Deception:** The OCSO website claims the system is "subject to audit" to protect privacy. However, a public audit that hides the who (officer) and the why (case number) is an audit in name only.

## 6. Legal & Privacy Conclusion

Florida Law (s. 501.171, F.S. and the 2024 Digital Bill of Rights) now recognizes geolocation data as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) when it is "reasonably linkable" to an individual.

* **The Reality:** The OCSO system uses the "one-hop" linkability of a license plate to create a historical geolocation archive of citizens.
* **The Hazard:** If the public is told data is deleted in 30 days, but the police are searching data from 524 days ago for a "stolen tag," the "Plain View" doctrine is being used as a cover for a permanent, warrantless tracking database.

**Summary Finding:** The OCSO ALPR implementation operates with a historical reach and a lack of transparency that contradicts its public-facing privacy promises. The system's ability to "time travel" back 1.5 years across a network of 100,000 devices transforms the car license plate into a permanent tracking beacon.
