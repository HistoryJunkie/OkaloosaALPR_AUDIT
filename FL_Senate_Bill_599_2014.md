31 (d) "Criminal justice agency" has the same meaning as

33 (2) The following information held by an agency is

35 of the State Constitution:
36 (a) Images and data obtained through the use of an

53 Review Act in accordance with s. 119.15 and shall stand repealed 
54 on October 2, 2019, unless reviewed and saved from repeal 
55 through reenactment by the Legislature.
56 Section 2. The Legislature finds that it is a public 
57 necessity that images and data obtained through the use of an 
58 automated license plate recognition system held by an agency and 
59 personal identifying information in data generated from such 
60 images be made confidential and exempt from s. 119.07(1), 
61 Florida Statutes, and s. 24(a), Article I of the State 
62 Constitution. The exemption protects sensitive personal 
63 information that, if released, could be defamatory to an 
64 individual or jeopardize the safety of an individual by allowing 
65 a third party to track a person's movements and compile a 
66 history on where a person has driven. This exemption is 
67 necessary because the public disclosure of such information 
68 constitutes an unwarranted invasion into the personal life and 
69 privacy of a person. The harm from disclosing such information 
70 outweighs any public benefit that can be derived from widespread 
71 and unregulated public access to such information.
72 Section 3. This act shall take effect July 1, 2014.
