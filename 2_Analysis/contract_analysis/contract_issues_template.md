## Issue Tracking

### 1. Unauthorized Disclosure Authority (STATUTORY VIOLATION)

**MSA Section:** 5.3

**Contract Language:**
> "Flock may access, use, preserve and/or disclose the Footage to law enforcement authorities, government officials, and/or third parties, if legally required to do so or if Flock has a good faith belief that such access, use, preservation or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a legal process, enforce this Agreement, or detect, prevent or otherwise address security, privacy, fraud or technical issues, or emergency situations."

**Florida Law:**
> FL Statute §316.0777(4)(a): ALPR data may be disclosed "by or to a criminal justice agency in the performance of the criminal justice agency's official duties"

**Legal Violation:**
- [x] Flock Safety is NOT a "criminal justice agency" as defined by FL §119.011(4)
- [x] Contract grants private corporation discretionary disclosure authority
- [x] "Good faith belief" standard not found in statute
- [x] Lacks procedural safeguards required for confidential law enforcement data

**Recommendation:**
Amend contract to remove Flock's independent disclosure authority. All disclosures should require OCSO authorization as the criminal justice agency.

---

### 2. Commercial Use of Data (STATUTORY VIOLATION)

**MSA Section:** 4.3

**Contract Language:**
> "Flock shall have the right to collect, analyze, and anonymize Customer Data and Customer Generated Data... Customer hereby grants Flock a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free right to use and distribute such Anonymized Data to improve and enhance the Services and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes, and other Flock offerings."

**Florida Law:**
> FDLE Guidelines §2.b: "ALPRs and data generated by ALPRs shall be used only for a criminal justice purpose"
> FDLE Guidelines §4.c: "All data...are the property of the collecting agency"

**Legal Violation:**
- [x] AI/ML training is NOT a "criminal justice purpose"
- [x] Product development for "other Flock offerings" is commercial use
- [x] Contradicts FDLE statement that data belongs to collecting agency
- [x] County receives no compensation for commercially valuable training data

**Recommendation:**
Remove perpetual commercial license. Limit Flock's data use to service delivery only.

---

### 3. Retention Period Exceeded (STATUTORY VIOLATION)

**MSA Section:** 4.3

**Contract Language:**
> "perpetual, royalty-free right to use and distribute such Anonymized Data"

**Florida Law:**
> FL Statute §316.0777(2)(d): Data "may not be retained longer than the maximum period provided in the retention schedule established pursuant to s. 316.0778"
> FL Department of State GS2 Item #217: "Retain...no longer than 3 anniversary years"
> FDLE Guidelines §6.e: Data "may be retained for no longer than 3 anniversary years"

**Legal Violation:**
- [x] "Perpetual" directly contradicts 3-year maximum
- [x] Statute uses "may not" - this is a prohibition, not guideline
- [x] Even "anonymized" data subject to retention limits
- [x] No mechanism in contract to enforce deletion after 3 years

**Recommendation:**
Replace "perpetual" with "3 years from collection date" and require certification of deletion.

---

### 4. Ineffective Anonymization (INTERNAL CONTRADICTION)

**MSA Sections:** 1.1 and 1.14

**Contract Language - Anonymization Definition (§1.1):**
> "Anonymized Data means Customer Data permanently stripped of identifying details and any potential personally identifiable information, by commercially available standards which irreversibly alters data in such a way that a data subject (i.e., individual person or entity) can no longer be identified directly or indirectly."

**Contract Language - Vehicle Fingerprint (§1.14):**
> "Vehicle Fingerprint means the unique vehicular attributes captured through Services such as: type, make, color, state registration, missing/covered plates, bumper stickers, decals, roof racks, and bike racks."

**Internal Contradiction:**
- [x] "Vehicle Fingerprint" creates persistent unique identifier
- [x] Unique attributes enable tracking specific vehicles over time
- [x] The vehicle itself becomes the identifiable data subject
- [x] Does NOT meet contract's own standard of "can no longer be identified"

**Legal Implication:**
If "anonymized" data contains persistent identifiers, then:
- Perpetual commercial rights may violate retention statute
- Criminal justice purpose restriction still applies
- Data may still qualify as PII under FL §501.171

**Recommendation:**
Require independent verification of anonymization effectiveness. Define technical standards that actually prevent re-identification.

---

### 5. Liability Limitations

**MSA Section:** 9.1

**Contract Language:**
> "FLOCK... SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE... FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE FEES PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY CUSTOMER TO FLOCK FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT OR OMISSION"

**Issue:**
- Flock's liability capped at 12 months of fees paid
- Excludes indirect, consequential, and exemplary damages
- Excludes "incomplete, corrupt, or inaccurate data"

**Risk to County:**
- [x] Data breach affecting citizens - county bears costs beyond fee cap
- [x] Wrongful arrest based on faulty data - no Flock liability
- [x] System failure during critical incident - limited recourse

**Comparable Contracts:**
- [ ] Research other government contracts for liability terms
- [ ] Industry standard for surveillance technology vendors

**Recommendation:**
Negotiate higher liability cap or carve-outs for data breaches and gross negligence.

---

### 6. Third-Party Disclosure Process

**MSA Section:** 5.3

**Issue:**
- Already identified as statutory violation (see Issue #1)
- Additional concerns beyond legal violation:

**Concerns:**
- [x] "Good faith belief" is subjective standard
- [x] No notification requirement to county
- [x] Could bypass county's own disclosure policies
- [x] Conflicts with Florida public records process

**Recommendation:**
All disclosure requests must be routed through OCSO. Flock should have no independent disclosure authority.

---

### 7. Auto-Renewal & Termination

**MSA Section:** 7.1, 7.2

**Contract Language:**
> "this Agreement will automatically renew for successive renewal terms of the greater of one year or the length set forth on the Order Form... unless either Party gives the other Party notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days prior to the end of the then-current term"

**Issue:**
- Auto-renews unless 30-day notice given
- Renewal term: greater of 1 year or original term length

**Concerns:**
- [x] Short notice window easy to miss
- [x] Long lock-in periods
- [x] No price protection on renewal (§6.2 allows 60-day notice of fee changes)
- [x] Limited termination rights (material breach only)

**Recommendation:**
Extend notice period to 90 days. Add price cap on renewals.

---

### 8. Feedback/IP Assignment

**MSA Section:** 11.9

**Contract Language:**
> "If Customer or Authorized End User provides any suggestions, ideas, enhancement requests, feedback, recommendations or other information relating to the subject matter hereunder, Agency or Authorized End User hereby assigns to Flock all right, title and interest (including intellectual property rights)"

**Issue:**
- Any suggestions from county become Flock's intellectual property
- Includes "all right, title and interest"

**Concerns:**
- [x] Deputies' operational feedback becomes Flock asset
- [x] Improvements suggested by county benefit Flock commercially
- [x] No compensation for valuable operational insights

**Recommendation:**
Limit IP assignment to patentable inventions. Retain rights to operational feedback.
