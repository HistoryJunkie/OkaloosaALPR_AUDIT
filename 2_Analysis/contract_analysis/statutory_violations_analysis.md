# Legal Analysis: Okaloosa County Flock Safety Contract

## Potential Statutory Violations

Based on review of the Master Service Agreement between Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office and Flock Safety (effective September 22, 2023), the following provisions appear to conflict with Florida law.

---

## Summary of Violations

| Issue | MSA Section | Law Violated | Severity |
|-------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Unauthorized Disclosure | §5.3 | FL §316.0777(4)(a) | **High** |
| Commercial Use | §4.3 | FDLE Guidelines §2.b | **High** |
| Retention Exceeded | §4.3 | FL §316.0777(2)(d), §316.0778 | **High** |
| Ineffective Anonymization | §1.1 vs §1.14 | Internal Contradiction | **Medium** |

## Issue 1: Unauthorized Disclosure Authority

### Florida Law

> **FL Statute §316.0777(4)(a):** ALPR data may be disclosed "by or to a criminal justice agency in the performance of the criminal justice agency's official duties"

> **FL Statute §119.011(4):** Defines "criminal justice agency" as law enforcement agencies, courts, prosecutors, and agencies with criminal law enforcement duties

### Contract Provision

> **Section 5.3:** Permits Flock Safety to disclose data "to law enforcement authorities, government officials, and/or third parties" based on Flock's "good faith belief" that disclosure is "reasonably necessary"

### Legal Concern

Flock Safety is **not** a criminal justice agency as defined by statute. The contract grants a private corporation discretionary disclosure authority that statute reserves exclusively for criminal justice agencies performing official duties. The subjective "good faith belief" standard is not found in statute and lacks the procedural safeguards required for disclosure of confidential law enforcement data.

---

## Issue 2: Commercial Use Prohibited by Law

### Florida Law

> **FDLE Guidelines §2.b:** "ALPRs and data generated by ALPRs shall be used only for a criminal justice purpose"

> **FDLE Guidelines §4.c:** "All data...are the property of the collecting agency"

### Contract Provision

> **Section 4.3:** Grants Flock "non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free right to use and distribute such Anonymized Data to improve and enhance the Services and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes, and other Flock offerings" including "training of machine learning algorithms"

### Legal Concern

Commercial AI training and product development for "other Flock offerings" does **not** constitute a "criminal justice purpose." The perpetual commercial license contradicts FDLE's explicit statement that data "are the property of the collecting agency."

---

## Issue 3: Statutory Retention Limit Exceeded

### Florida Law

> **FL Statute §316.0777(2)(d):** Data "may not be retained longer than the maximum period provided in the retention schedule established pursuant to s. 316.0778"

> **FL Statute §316.0778(2):** Department of State shall establish maximum retention schedule

> **FL Department of State GS2 Item #217:** "Retain...no longer than 3 anniversary years unless required to be retained under another record series"

> **FDLE Guidelines §6.e:** Data "may be retained for no longer than 3 anniversary years"

### Contract Provision

> **Section 4.3:** Grants Flock "perpetual" rights to use anonymized data

### Legal Concern

"Perpetual" retention **directly contradicts** the mandatory 3-year maximum retention period established by statute and regulation. The statute uses "may not" language, indicating this is a prohibition, not a guideline.

---

## Issue 4: Ineffective Anonymization

### Contract Provisions

> **Section 1.1 (Anonymized Data):** "permanently stripped of identifying details...which irreversibly alters data in such a way that a data subject (i.e., individual person or entity) can no longer be identified directly or indirectly"

> **Section 1.14 (Vehicle Fingerprint):** "unique vehicular attributes captured through Services such as: type, make, color, state registration, missing/covered plates, bumper stickers, decals, roof racks, and bike racks"

### Technical Concern

The contract's definition of "anonymization" is **contradicted by its own technical specifications**. A "Vehicle Fingerprint" consisting of unique attributes creates a persistent identifier that enables tracking of specific vehicles over time. The vehicle itself becomes the trackable data subject. This does not meet the contract's own standard of data that "can no longer be identified directly or indirectly."

### Legal Implication

If "anonymized" data actually contains persistent identifiers, then granting perpetual commercial rights may violate both:
- The retention statute
- The criminal-justice-purpose restriction

## Legal Framework

The Florida Legislature explicitly addressed ALPR privacy concerns in 2014 by:

1. Making ALPR data confidential and exempt from public records (§316.0777(3))
2. Limiting disclosure to criminal justice agencies (§316.0777(4)(a))
3. Mandating maximum retention schedules (§316.0777(2)(d) + §316.0778)
4. Requiring data be used "only for a criminal justice purpose" (FDLE §2.b)

These provisions reflect legislative findings that ALPR data poses unique privacy risks because it:

> "could be defamatory to an individual or jeopardize the safety of an individual by allowing a third party to track a person's movements and compile a history on where a person has driven"
>
> — *Senate Bill 599, Section 2, 2014*

## Recommended Actions

1. **Legal review** by County Attorney to assess contract validity
2. **Consultation** with Florida Department of Law Enforcement on compliance
3. **Review** of similar contracts by other Florida agencies
4. **Consider contract amendment** to align with statutory requirements
5. **Public disclosure** of current data handling practices
