**RE:** Public Records Request - ALPR Camera Locations

---

Dear Public Records Officer:

Pursuant to Florida's Public Records Law, Chapter 119, Florida Statutes, I am requesting the following records related to the Okaloosa County Sheriff's Office Flock Safety ALPR (Automated License Plate Recognition) camera deployments:

### Camera Location Information

1. **GPS coordinates or street addresses** of all ALPR cameras owned, operated, or accessed by OCSO, including:
   - Flock Safety cameras installed on public property
   - Flock Safety cameras on private property with OCSO access
   - Any third-party ALPR cameras integrated with OCSO systems

2. **Camera installation records**, including:
   - Installation dates for each camera
   - Approval documentation for each location
   - Any site surveys or assessments conducted

3. **Deployment Plan** referenced in the Flock Safety Master Services Agreement Section 10.2, including:
   - Strategic geographic mapping
   - Location selection criteria
   - Any locations vetoed by Flock per Section 10.2

4. **Camera coverage maps** or network diagrams, if such documents exist

5. **Any demographic or crime data analysis** used to determine camera placement locations

### Anticipated Exemption Response

I am aware that law enforcement may claim security exemptions for infrastructure locations. However, I note that:

- ALPR cameras are visible surveillance devices in public spaces
- Citizens have a legitimate interest in knowing where they are being recorded
- Many jurisdictions publicly disclose ALPR camera locations
- Aggregate location data (without operational details) poses minimal security risk

If you claim an exemption, please:
1. Cite the specific statutory exemption
2. Explain how disclosure would harm security interests
3. Consider providing redacted or aggregated data as a compromise

### Preferred Format

Please provide records in electronic format. For coordinate data, CSV or GIS-compatible formats (shapefile, KML, GeoJSON) are preferred.

### Fee Waiver Request

[Optional]
I request a fee waiver as disclosure serves the public interest in understanding the scope and distribution of government surveillance infrastructure.

### Response Timeline

Per Florida Statutes Section 119.07, I expect a response within a reasonable time.

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Contact Information]
