**RE:** Appeal of Redactions to ALPR Audit Log Records

---

Dear Sheriff [Name]:

I am writing to formally appeal the redactions applied to the ALPR audit log records provided in response to my public records request dated [original request date].

### Records at Issue

The provided records (809-page audit log covering November 1 - December 8, 2025) contain 100% redaction of:
1. Officer/deputy names
2. Case numbers or incident references

### Basis for Appeal

#### 1. No Valid Exemption Cited

The records were provided without citation to a specific statutory exemption authorizing the redactions. Florida law requires that any exemption be expressly provided by statute.

#### 2. Public Interest in Accountability

The redactions prevent any meaningful audit of ALPR system use:

- **463 searches** accessed data older than the publicly stated 30-day retention policy
- **9 searches** contained no stated justification
- Without officer identifiers, it is impossible to determine if these were policy violations, training issues, or isolated incidents
- Without case numbers, it is impossible to verify that searches served legitimate criminal justice purposes

#### 3. No Security Interest

Unlike operational intelligence or investigative techniques, audit logs serve an accountability function. Disclosure of:
- Which officers conducted searches
- What cases were referenced

...does not compromise any ongoing investigation or security interest, as the searches have already occurred.

#### 4. Precedent for Disclosure

Audit logs and accountability records are routinely disclosed in other jurisdictions. The purpose of audit logs is precisely to enable oversight - redacting them defeats their entire purpose.

#### 5. Inconsistency with Public Statements

OCSO publicly states that its ALPR system is "subject to audit" to protect citizen privacy. A fully redacted audit log cannot serve this purpose and renders the public assurance meaningless.

### Requested Resolution

I request that OCSO:

1. **Provide unredacted audit logs** including officer names and case numbers; OR

2. **Cite specific statutory exemptions** for each category of redaction, with explanation of how the exemption applies; OR

3. **Provide partially unredacted records** with:
   - Officer badge numbers or unique identifiers (if names are exempt)
   - Case number categories (if specific numbers are exempt)
   - Sufficient information to enable accountability review

### Legal Consultation Notice

If this appeal is denied, I intend to seek legal consultation regarding enforcement of Florida's public records law, including potential action under Section 119.12, Florida Statutes.

### Response Requested

Please respond to this appeal within 10 business days.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
[Contact Information]

## Supporting Arguments

### Relevant Florida Statutes

- **119.07(1)(a)**: "Every person who has custody of a public record shall permit the record to be inspected and copied..."
- **119.07(1)(d)**: Exemptions must be "provided by law"
- **119.12**: Attorney's fees for improperly denied requests

### Questions for Legal Research

1. Are officer names in audit logs exempt under any Florida statute?
2. Are case numbers considered investigative records even in aggregate audit context?
3. Has any Florida court addressed ALPR audit log disclosure?
4. What is the standard for "active investigation" exemption when case is referenced in audit log?

### Alternative Approaches

If full disclosure is denied:

1. Request statistical summary (searches by officer anonymized ID)
2. Request case category breakdown without specific numbers
3. Request records with time-limited redactions (cases >1 year old unredacted)
4. File complaint with Florida Attorney General
