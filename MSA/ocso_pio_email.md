Dear OCSO Public Information Officer,

I am writing to request clarification regarding the Flock Safety data retention policy as described in the FAQ posted on January 12, 2026, on the OCSO website.

The FAQ states: "Captured data is retained for 30 days and deleted when the data is not designated as evidence in a criminal investigation. User queries which contain the user profile are retained indefinitely to allow the Agency Administrator to conduct audits to ensure user compliance."

I would appreciate clarification on the following points:

**1. Definition of "Captured Data"**
Does "captured data" refer exclusively to the camera footage itself (images, video, audio), or does it encompass all data generated by the Flock system, including metadata, vehicle characteristics, license plate reads, timestamps, and location information?

**2. Scope of Data Deleted After 30 Days**
When "captured data" is deleted after 30 days, what specific information is removed? Based on the OCSO Master Service Agreement with Flock Safety, "Customer Data" is defined to include "Footage" (still images, video, audio and other data captured by the cameras). Does the 30-day deletion apply only to this footage, or to all associated data?



I recognize the valuable role Flock Safety cameras play in public safety, and I appreciate the transparency provided through the FAQ. These clarifications would help the public better understand what data is collected, how long it is retained, and under what circumstances it may be accessed or disclosed.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
